This repository demonstrates a common issue with the React Native `Dimensions` API when used in simulators.  The problem arises from discrepancies between the simulator's screen resolution and the target device's resolution. This can lead to unexpected layout behavior in your app. The `DimensionsBug.js` file showcases the inaccurate dimension retrieval, and `DimensionsBugSolution.js` provides a solution using a more robust approach.
