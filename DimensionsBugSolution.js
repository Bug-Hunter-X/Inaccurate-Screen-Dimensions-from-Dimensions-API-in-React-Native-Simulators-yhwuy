To fix this, use the `onLayout` prop of the top-level component in your app to get the accurate dimensions of the screen after it has been rendered. This event fires after the layout of the component has been calculated. This way, the dimensions retrieved are accurate, regardless of the simulator or device used.

```javascript
export default function MyComponent() {
  const [screenDimensions, setScreenDimensions] = useState(null);

  const handleLayout = (event) => {
    const { width, height } = event.nativeEvent.layout;
    setScreenDimensions({ width, height });
  };

  return (
    <View onLayout={handleLayout}>
      {screenDimensions && (
        <Text>Screen Width: {screenDimensions.width}px</Text>
      )}
      {screenDimensions && (
        <Text>Screen Height: {screenDimensions.height}px</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
}
```
